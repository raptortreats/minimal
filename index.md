### HERG toxicity model

• A machine learning model which predicts if the molecule is herg toxic or not.
• This is a classification model used for predicting toxic or intoxic.
• Used Deep Neural Networks for these predictions.
• Later these models were used for predicting of toxic and intoxic molecules.
• Performed similarity maps where it predicts the toxicity of every part of a 
 molecule.
